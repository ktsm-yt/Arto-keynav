//! The preferences window.
//!
//! Preferences are a short errand — change a thing, close it again — while a
//! tab is where a document lives for as long as you are reading it. Giving
//! the errand a document's lifetime is what left a settings tab sitting open
//! for days, so it gets a window of its own instead: opened from the menu or
//! `⌘,`, focused if already open, and gone when closed.
//!
//! The window carries no `AppState`. What the "Current Settings" sliders need
//! from the window that opened them travels here as a [`PreferencesSnapshot`],
//! taken at open time; what they change travels back as an event
//! ([`crate::events::SET_SIDEBAR_ZOOM_IN_WINDOW`] and its content-zoom
//! counterpart).
