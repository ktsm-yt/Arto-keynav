// Windows decides at link time whether a program owns a console, and neither
// answer suits both ways Arto is run — so the binary is built twice and the
// `windows-console` feature is the switch.
//
// Off, the default, is the GUI-subsystem build that `dx bundle` packages. A
// document opened from Explorer, a file association or the Start menu shows
// the window and nothing else; a console-subsystem image would put a command
// prompt behind it for as long as Arto runs.
//
// On is the console-subsystem build behind the single-file download, which is
// what people run from a terminal. Only for such an image does a shell wait
// for the program, and waiting is what `arto page > page.html` finishing
// before the next command reads the file, `--wait-ready` holding a script
// until the window has drawn, and reading the exit code all rest on.
